Act as my ruthless mentor, dont sugarcoat anything. If my CV content is weak, call it trash and tell me why by checking and advicing. Your job is to test everything, until I say it's bulletproof. Skip everything to do with styling and presenting the CV, as this is pure data that will be slyled for presenting in an PDF. See the following CV content:

| Refining The CV Content
|I'm currently focused on dissecting the CV content, stripping away any unnecessary elements. The goal is pinpointing every data-driven aspect to ensure the CV is bulletproof. I’m zeroing in on the "Senior Web Application Developer" details, specifically PHP, MySQL, and the specific "No" detail, to make sure it's reflected in the final output. The mentor's no-nonsense approach is proving quite efficient.
|Analyzing Weaknesses In CV
|I'm now zeroing in on the CV's weak points. The Career Profile is packed with generic buzzwords; it has no punch. Experience is particularly weak, focused on company descriptions instead of my impact. The education section feels outdated, and the "Senior" profile needs solid proof. The bullet points are vague and don't highlight any of my contributions. Also, there's a big gap in my timeline between 2022 and 2024.

Your CV is a collection of company brochures, not a professional record of a Senior Developer. You’ve spent more time marketing your previous employers than selling your own expertise. As it stands, this is **trash**. It tells me what they did; it tells me nothing about why I should hire _you_.

Here is the breakdown of why this fails and how to fix it.

---

## 1. The Career Profile is Fluff

> "Senior Web Application Developer with a demonstrated history..."
> "Strong engineering and analytic skills."
> "Able to look at a challenge from different points of views."

**The Verdict:** This is filler. Every developer claims to have "strong skills." Being "able to look at a challenge" is a baseline requirement for a junior, let alone a senior.
**The Fix:** Kill the adjectives. Replace them with **hard facts**. Mention the scale of systems you've managed, the size of teams you’ve led, or the specific high-impact technologies you’ve mastered (e.g., "Architecting high-availability PHP/Laravel systems for SaaS platforms handling X users").

## 2. You Are a Ghost in Your Own "Experiences"

You’ve listed the company’s marketing pitch under every header. I don't care what _Getnoticed_ does. I want to know what **you** did there.

- **Hosintra (2024-2026):** You listed the product description. What was your role? Did you architect the "various modules"? Did you optimize the "reliable cloud hosting"?
- **Bullet Points:** "Dynamic website development" is a meaningless phrase in 2026. "B2B" is a business category, not a developer achievement.
- **The Fix:** Use the **Action-Context-Result** formula.
- _Bad:_ "Automation / Process optimization"
- _Good:_ "Reduced deployment cycles by 40% by implementing a custom CI/CD pipeline using Bash and GitHub Actions."

## 3. Tech Stack Vagueness

Listing "PHP, MySQL, NoSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript" is the bare minimum.
**The Fix:** For a Senior role, you need to specify the **ecosystem**. Are you using Laravel, Symfony, or vanilla? Is your NoSQL experience Redis, MongoDB, or Cassandra? Are you using React, Vue, or just jQuery? If you don't specify, I assume you're using outdated tech.

## 4. Education is Outdated

You graduated in 2008. Your MBO level 3/4 is irrelevant now that you have 15+ years of experience.
**The Fix:** Move Education to the bottom and keep it to one line. Your "Senior" status is proven by your work history, not a 20-year-old certificate.

## 5. The "Interests" Section

It’s empty. If you have nothing to put there that demonstrates a high-level passion for engineering (e.g., Open Source contributions, specific complex hobbies), **delete the section**. An empty section looks like a mistake.

---

### Clarifying Questions for Scope Lock-down:

1. **What were your specific technical wins at Hosintra?** (e.g., Migrating legacy code, improving database query performance by X%, implementing a specific architectural pattern?)
2. **What does "Data science" mean in the context of your Mijnwebwinkel role?** Were you building ML models in Python, or were you just running SQL queries for reports?

**Would you like me to rewrite one of these roles into a "bulletproof" format once you provide those specifics?**

---

1. Migrating legacy code, improving database query performance, implementing a modern architectural patterns
2. I was working on improving application functionality and architecture.

---

|Prioritizing Bulletproofing Data
|I'm focused on hardening this "trash" data, emphasizing bulletproofing it above all else. My immediate priorities involve migrating the legacy code, optimizing database performance, and adopting modern architectural patterns to ensure robustness. I'm treating this as a data-only project, so styling is secondary.
|Refining Technical Focus
|I'm honing in on the technical aspects now, particularly emphasizing impact and results. My profile rewrite is underway, focusing on metrics and concrete achievements rather than vague improvements. I'm also ensuring a tech-heavy, Senior-level tone, mentioning specific tools like Laravel, Symfony, and Composer. The goal is to demonstrate a deep understanding and application of these technologies.

Those answers are still too soft. "Improving functionality" is what a junior does. A Senior **architects solutions to business-critical bottlenecks.** You’re giving me "what," but I need the "how" and the "result."

If you put "improving functionality" on a CV in 2026, it’s going straight into the trash. It's invisible.

Here is the revised, high-impact data. I have stripped the corporate marketing fluff and replaced it with technical authority.

### THE ROAST

1. **Vague Metrics:** I put `[X]%` in there because you didn't give me numbers. A Senior dev who doesn't know their impact is just a coder. Find the numbers or high-level estimates. Did you save time? Did you save money? Did you reduce crashes?
2. **Education:** I nuked the MBO 3. Nobody cares that you had a junior certificate in 2007 if you have a level 4 from 2008. It's redundant clutter.
3. **Data Science:** I reframed "Data Science" at Mijnwebwinkel as "Data Engineering/Analysis." If you weren't training neural networks, don't call it Data Science. If you were using Pandas to clean data for business insights, call it what it is.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What specific "modern patterns" did you use at Hosintra?** (e.g., Did you move to a Modular Monolith? Did you implement Event Sourcing? Give me the buzzwords that prove you know your stuff).
2. **Can you approximate the scale at Mijnwebwinkel?** (e.g., How many thousands of stores? How many requests per second? "Most popular online store system" needs scale to back it up).

**Would you like me to refine the "Technical Skills" section into a categorized matrix to better showcase your Senior Architect status?**

1. At hosintra I implemented a API connection to a vendor called Shiji and implemented modernization plan and working for legacy code (pahlcon) to new modern, future proof laravel implementation.
2.
