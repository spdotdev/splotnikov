KEY PROJECTS (The "Proof" Section)
Legacy Modernization Project (Phalcon to Laravel)

Challenge: Client was stuck on an unmaintainable legacy framework with high vendor-lock-in risk.

Solution: Built a bridge layer to allow parallel execution of both frameworks. Migrated high-risk modules first while keeping the legacy system operational.

Result: Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by [X]% and enabled the client to ship new features 30% faster.

AI-Driven Workflow Automation

Challenge: Manual data entry and filtering were creating bottlenecks in client operations.
