## 01 / The Manifesto

### Engineering for ROI, Not Trends

The most expensive line of code is the one that shouldn't have been written. I don't follow "Cargo Cult" architecture. While others over-engineer with microservices they can't manage, I advocate for **Modular Monoliths** and **Pragmatic Scaling**.

- **Pragmatism Over Hype:** I choose stacks based on talent pipelines and TCO, not GitHub stars.
- **The Strangler Fig Strategy:** No "grand rewrites." I believe in the seamless, incremental replacement of legacy debt while maintaining 100% business continuity.
- **Systems Thinking:** A ticket developer closes tasks; an architect anticipates the 24-month trade-off of every structural decision.

## 02 / Selected Proof

### Modernizing a Monolith: Phalcon to Laravel

- **The Mess:** A client was trapped in a legacy Phalcon system, unable to scale or find specialized talent.
- **The Solution:** Engineered a custom PHP middleware layer to bridge the two frameworks. Implemented an incremental migration strategy (Strangler Fig Pattern).
- **The Impact:** Achieved a **[60]% reduction in latency** and reducing unnecessary overheads that lead to more streamlined and efficient processes with **zero downtime**.

### AI-Driven Workflow Integration

- **The Mess:** Manual data processing bottlenecks were stalling business operations.
- **The Solution:** Integrating LLM agents into sales stack replaced rigid, manual processes with autonomous AI that researches prospects.
- **The Impact:** Reclaimed **[16] hours/week** of manual labor through automated agentic workflows.
