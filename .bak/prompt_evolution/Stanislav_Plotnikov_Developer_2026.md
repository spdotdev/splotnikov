### KEY PROJECTS (The "Proof" Section)

#### Legacy Modernization Project (Phalcon to Laravel)

- Challenge: Client was stuck on an unmaintainable legacy framework with high vendor-lock-in risk.
- Solution: Built a bridge layer to allow parallel execution of both frameworks. Migrated high-risk modules first while keeping the legacy system operational.
- Result: Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and enabled the client to ship new features [30%] faster.

#### Automation & AI-Driven Workflow

- Challenge: Manual data entry and filtering were creating bottlenecks in client operations.
