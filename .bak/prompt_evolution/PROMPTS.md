As this onepage is going to get deployed on GitHub and I setup a custom domain, I want the users to be able to print a CV when they view my webpage. I created an file called CV.md with content about me. Suggest improvements to the data until the it looks

Act as my ruthless mentor, dont sugarcoat anything. If my CV content is weak, call it trash and tell me why by checking and advicing. Your job is to test everything, until I say it's bulletproof. Skip everything to do with styling and presenting the CV, as this is pure data that will be slyled for presenting in an PDF. See the following CV content idea:

Create a plan how would you solve the following:

TASK:
In the file "Stanislav_Plotnikov_Developer_2026.md" is my CV. I want to create a new page where reqruiters web users can view my resume. The layout should be the same as my portfolio page.

FUNCTIONALITY:
PRINT: I want to be able to print the page on one A4 format paper. Preferably keeping the styling, but if that changes slightly or will be basic and proffesional, I am fine with that.
PDF: And I also want to be able to generate a ATS-Optimized PDF document from that page. The content in the pdf should fit into one A4 format.

---

Yes tweak the font to always fit on a A4 format.

- also I want to add a circulair image on the right side of the page, where I can add my profile picture
- also when I download PDF on dark mode the style in the pdf is terrible as the dark background surrounds the content but the edges are white. Any suggestions?
- also the content in the pdf should stretch to fill the page. Now the A4 is half filled with content. the same goes for print, the A4 should be filled

---

LAYOUT:

- generate an sample image for the profile.jpg
- rearage some content to be underneath my profile image, this looks empty now on the right side of the page.
- in th PDF and on the print page some content is not visible at all or is barely visible. Is this becourse of the gray font?
- the PDF and print differ in styling, make sure they are always the same

---

No the block "Core Competencies" looks out of place and messy.

- put block "Core Competencies" back
- be creative and suggest how I can fill the empty space unther the profile image
- The links and contact information looks oke isch there, maybe alighn it better and give contact info some space. It looks crumpt up.
- also on the pdf the profile image stays on the right, but on the print it moved up before the content.
- also on the pdf the content looks thin and the margin left and right is to much.

---

- better, but PDF is now 2 A4 pages and print cuts the content at the buttom
- on the pdf the profile image alighned left and differs from the print. Make sure the are identical.
- pdf still looks like it has to much margin left and right
- on the print the page looks fine when I select margin none in the options

---

ok, now it looks a let better

- still be creative to fill the block underneath the profile picture, it should look modern but proffesional
- also change the link for linkedin and github to show the url, as if the page is printed there is no way for the user to see the url to go to

---

better, I like what you did with expertise block, can you add more content like that in the right block
